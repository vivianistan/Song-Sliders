# Song-Sliders
A game written for EE 319K by CS and VT

*If you are taking the class now, please do not use this code. Come up with your own, it will be more fun.*

Simple game in which an alien slides across the screen in order to catch notes

When a note is caught by the alien, the next note in a selected song will play

Song loops infinitely, getting progressively faster, until the alien runs out of lives 

Needs quite a bit of file cleanup. 

The following updates would be nice: (increasing difficulty?)

    -Add unique graphics to song screens (bit maps?)

    -Change note symbol based on song (sub for other chars/bitmaps)

    -Have the game loop back to Start after GAME OVER 

    -have note positions based on note pitch rather than random (big change)

    -Make songs longer/have an end instead of looping infinitely?
